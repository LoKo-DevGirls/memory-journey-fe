      "content": "Last Monday, I read a letter my wife found last weekend at my parent's home. The letter was written to me by my father over 30 years ago when I was living abroad. It was rare that he wrote to me, and re-reading the letter now that I myself have a child, I can see very clearly how disappointed he was with me. I was a scriptwriter, but in reality, I had still not found my way in life, and I was 30. Being the eldest and a male, his disappointment was even more heartfelt. We get so engrossed in our own truths, our own dreams that when we find someone who doesn't agree with us, we automatically presume they don't understand. Feeling his justifiable disappointment and realizing that if he could look down from wherever he is, he would be, I think, very pleased. It has taken a long time, but he would see that I have found my path. I would give him, in my defense, the example of Lorenza da Ponte, the playwright, and librettist of Mozart's \"Cosi Fan Tutte,\" \"Le Nozze di Figaro,\" and \"Don Giovanni.\" From being a feted librettist and a \"Don Giovanni\" himself, he ended up in England, got married, went to America with the Pilgrim Fathers, and had 4 kids and became a farmer as an old man. The idea that you can live various lives in one is possible. From my own personal story, all the many steps, right or wrong, have led me, with an inexorable logic, here, to where I am today. Can my father look down from somewhere and see this? I hope and pray that he can.",
